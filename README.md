# 🫀 Heart Disease Detection

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has heart disease based on medical parameters and personal health data.

## 📌 Objective

Develop a classification model that determines whether a patient has heart disease using various health indicators.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized patient health data including both numeric and categorical features. Each row corresponds to a patient, with a target label indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

### 🔍 Features

| Feature | Description | Type |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `age` | Age of the patient (in years) | Numeric |
| `sex` | Sex (0 = female, 1 = male) | Binary |
| `chest pain type` | Type of chest pain (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal, 4 = asymptomatic) | Nominal |
| `resting bp` | Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) | Numeric |
| `cholesterol` | Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl) | Numeric |
| `fasting blood sugar` | >120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false) | Binary |
| `resting ecg` | Resting electrocardiogram results (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T abnormality, 2 = LV hypertrophy) | Nominal |
| `max heart rate` | Maximum heart rate achieved | Numeric |
| `exercise angina` | Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no) | Binary |
| `oldpeak` | ST depression induced by exercise | Numeric |
| `ST slope` | Slope of the ST segment (1 = up, 2 = flat, 3 = down) | Nominal |
| `target` | Diagnosis (1 = Heart Disease, 0 = Normal) | Binary |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 📊 Model Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical features
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing distributions and correlations
   - Understanding feature importance

3. **Modeling**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Evaluation with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC
